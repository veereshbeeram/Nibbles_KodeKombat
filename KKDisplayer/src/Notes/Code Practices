        1. kodekombatserv/KKSnake
        2. kodekombatserv/KKArena
        3. kodekombatserv/KKArenaComponent

---------------------------------------------------------------------
RULES FOR COLLABORATIVE DEVELOPMENT:

- Developers stick to their code only. If it is required to enter the other
  developers domain do so at the knowledge of the assigned developer only.

- After significant code changes, developer has to unit test their code.

- Only after testing, code review meetings shall be organized.
  We'll see if code sharing is possible. Each developer reviews the other
  developers code. The codes have to be neatly commented. Any protocol used
  should be documented on the corresponding page on top. Do this as you are
  coding and not jst before the code review day.

- After code review, code shall be committed back to the server. Do not commit
  the code before this!!!
